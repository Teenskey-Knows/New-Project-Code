    "content": "Sing, youth, the loveliest song you know!\nSing the song that seethes within your breast,\nLet your joy burst forth in passion...\nDon't hold back your song! Let it soar.\n\nSing your song, youth. I beg you sing...\nLet it seize you, kiss you, inspire you to love\nWith youthful ardour... Let the foaming wave of feelings\nWhich your song arouses surge over us.\n\nSing your song, youth, and laugh like children!\nLet the sound of your voice rise to the heavens\nAnd echo back to us again, from the envious stars.\n\nFor we adore you, as we adore the sun.\nSing, youth! Sing your joyful song!\nLaugh, youth, laugh! The world is yours.",

    "content": "THE roads of the Sea\nAre thronged with merchantmen; \nEast and West, North and South\nThey go and come again. \n\nAll precious merchandise\nThey bear in their hold: \nLest the people be starving\nIn the night and cold. \n\nNow tell me, good merchants, \nHow this thing can be\nThat the white ships are thronging\nThe roads of the sea? \n\nFor there's death in the skies\nAnd there's death on the earth; \nAnd men talked of famine\nAnd a frozen hearth. \n\nYet the ships they go crowding\nThe roads of the sea; \nThey bring home their treasures\nTo you and to me. \n\nO listen, good people, \nAnd hearing, praise God, \nThat the watch-dogs are keeping\nThe ships on their road! \n\nThey sit watchful and steady\nWhere the North winds blow; \nSleepless they are keeping\nThe roads the ships go. \n\nIn the day, in the hour, \nThey will spring--until then, \nTheir eyes keep the courses\nOf the merchantmen. \n\nForget not, good people, \nWhen ye heap the white board, \nWhen ye draw to the hearth-fire, \nTo praise the Lord, \n\nThat the watch-dogs unsleeping\nKeep the roads of the Sea, \nUp by the Northern Lights \nWhere the great ships be.",

    "content": "O the breasts of youth\nO the pallid waters of the fig-eaters\nThe cobblestones echo with the steps of morning people\nThicket of strength with your scarlet trees\nYouth senses your significance\nAnd springs up already at your edges\nFeathery tresses frisk between the breasts of young girls\nWho walk half-naked through your narrow streets\nTheir curls more lovely than those of Absalom\nAmber drips between the locks\nAnd the dark-haired ones hold ebony leaves\nFerrets sniff at their steps\nThe forest responds\nThe forest is a swarm of ants with lance-bearing legions\nHere even the skylarks are stripping off their shadows\nThe railways cannot be heard\nThe day sighs\nOne of the her young daughters is playing with her breasts\nNo slap will do any good\nA deer passes by holding in its mouth\nThe three cherries it found between the breasts of youth\nThe evening here is warm\nThe trees wrap themselves in their quietude\nNow and then rocks of silence fall slowly into the clearing\nLike light before it turns to day.",

      "content": "Sing, youth, the loveliest song you know!\nSing the song that seethes within your breast,\nLet your joy burst forth in passion...\nDon't hold back your song! Let it soar.\n\nSing your song, youth. I beg you sing...\nLet it seize you, kiss you, inspire you to love\nWith youthful ardour... Let the foaming wave of feelings\nWhich your song arouses surge over us.\n\nSing your song, youth, and laugh like children!\nLet the sound of your voice rise to the heavens\nAnd echo back to us again, from the envious stars.\n\nFor we adore you, as we adore the sun.\nSing, youth! Sing your joyful song!\nLaugh, youth, laugh! The world is yours.",
